# High Grade common rules

Write authored text in the language set by the project instruction. An explicit user instruction takes priority. If no language is set, use the request language. English agent instructions do not set the language of answers, requirements, reports or user documents. Keep field names, IDs, commands, paths, machine statuses and original messages unchanged.

## Sources and authority

The active Delivery defines the common process. `.highgrade/project/INSTRUCTIONS.md` defines project commands, sources and accepted exceptions. The user defines the goal and authorized actions. Delivery instructions do not expand tool authority or override Codex mode limits. Apply accepted exceptions without another question. A new material conflict stops only the dependent action. Preserve unrelated changes. Do not scan adjacent projects or keep a central registry of them.

Each rule has one owner: common invariants here; route selection in [task](procedures/task.md#choose-a-sufficient-route); sufficient evidence and the review trigger in [work](procedures/work.md#evidence-and-review); the independent review method in [review](references/review.md) when called; stage actions in their procedure; project exceptions in the local instruction. The Delivery is self-contained and does not require High Grade repository documents.

Commit, activation, publication and a human decision have separate grounds. [Commit](procedures/commit.md) performs authorized local recording and project-assigned activation. [Push](procedures/push.md) performs explicitly requested publication. Silence and technical success do not imply acceptance. Handoff and decision recording belong to [work](procedures/work.md#handoff-to-a-human-and-decision-recording).

## Context and execution

On entry, read AGENTS, the local instruction and the sources needed for the task. On first entry, a Delivery change, a local instruction change or a material environment change, check [compatibility](references/cli.md#project-compatibility). Reuse unchanged context already read. Read it again after a source change, context loss or a specific contradiction. Switching skills alone does not require another diagnostic check.

Choose a sufficient route through task. Requirements and tasks have one primary source. A chain plan stores order and links, not a second backlog. [Planner](procedures/planner.md) coordinates dependent work when explicitly called or assigned by an accepted project route.

The main agent owns the result. An independent reviewer checks significant changes through work. A separate agent for each skill is unnecessary. Use a specialist for a specific need within available authority. Delegate only when the current session, user or applicable instruction permits it. Unavailable mandatory review remains a gap.

Maintain affected documents and history with the task. Before creating, materially editing or assessing documentation or comments, read [content and style rules](references/documentation.md). For a local edit with no meaning change, follow the local format and check the fragment. Ordinary reading does not require the reference. Reuse it under the context rules. Read [adaptation and budgets](references/audit.md#context-and-adaptation) when that work applies. Clear is an additional review on request.

Lead with the result, actual checks and material remainder. Use a long report only on request or to support a decision. If an external action is blocked, explain the actual cause once and continue independent authorized work. Do not request the same permission without a new reason.
